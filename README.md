# Minimax Algorithm applied to the Tic Tac Toe

## About the project

As part of my data structures and algorithms seminary, i'm developing a simple tic tac toe with the use of the Minimax algorithm as the second player. Not only that, the intention is to visualize and understand the decision making process by the AI. To do this, i'm using matplotlib, the python library that allows graphics ploting and interaction.

The visualization part of the project intends to ease the compreehension over binary trees and the decision making of AI, making it intuitive and acessible, even for non CompSci people.

## Current progress:

- ~~Tic tac toe working for 2 human players~~
- Tic tac toe working, it's possible to play against the AI, with the minimax algorithm determining the decisions

## Technologies used:

- Python
- Matplotlib
